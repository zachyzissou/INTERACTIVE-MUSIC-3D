## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **WebGPU compatibility**: Implement comprehensive fallbacks
2. **Audio timing**: Test across different devices/browsers
3. **Memory leaks**: Implement automated testing
4. **Breaking changes**: Maintain backward compatibility

### Mitigation Strategies

* Feature flags for experimental features
* Comprehensive testing on multiple devices
* Gradual rollout for major changes
* Rollback procedures for critical issues
