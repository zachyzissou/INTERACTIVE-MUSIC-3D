## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive technical review and resolution of critical issues in the Oscillo codebase, an interactive 3D music visualization application.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Infinite Re-render Issue in BottomDrawer âœ… FIXED
**Problem:** Maximum update depth exceeded causing app crashes
**Root Cause:** Unstable Zustand selectors causing excessive re-renders
**Solution:** 
- Implemented stable selectors using `useCallback` for all Zustand store subscriptions
- Optimized selector functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added proper memoization for computed values

**Before:**
```tsx
const objects = useObjects(s => s.objects)
const { selected, selectShape } = useSelectedShape(s => ({
  selected: s.selected,
  selectShape: s.selectShape,
}))
```

**After:**
```tsx
const objects = useObjects(useCallback(s => s.objects, []))
const selected = useSelectedShape(useCallback(s => s.selected, []))
const selectShape = useSelectedShape(useCallback(s => s.selectShape, []))
```

### 2. Tone.js Parameter Validation Errors âœ… FIXED
**Problem:** "param must be an AudioParam" runtime errors
**Root Cause:** Unsafe parameter initialization during Tone.js effect creation
**Solution:**
- Simplified effect initialization with minimal configuration
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Implemented safer parameter setting approach

**Before:**
```tsx
chorus = new Tone.Chorus({ frequency: 1.5, delayTime: 3.5, depth: 0.7, feedback: 0.2 })
```

**After:**
```tsx
try {
  chorus = new Tone.Chorus().toDestination()
  // Parameters set safely after creation
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to initialize audio effects:', error)
  masterChain = new Tone.Gain(1).toDestination() // Fallback
}
```

### 3. WebGL Context Loss Handling âœ… ENHANCED
**Problem:** WebGL context loss causing canvas failures
**Solution:**
- Enhanced `CanvasErrorBoundary` with automatic retry mechanism
- Added WebGL context loss detection and recovery
- Implemented progressive retry with exponential backoff
- Added user-friendly error messages with manual recovery options

### 4. Canvas Sizing & Responsiveness âœ… IMPROVED
**Problem:** Canvas sizing issues and WebGL context management
**Solution:**
- Enhanced canvas props with proper performance settings
- Added adaptive DPR (Device Pixel Ratio) handling
- Implemented context loss event handlers
- Added frameloop control based on context state

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Boundary System
- **CanvasErrorBoundary**: Specialized for WebGL/Canvas errors
