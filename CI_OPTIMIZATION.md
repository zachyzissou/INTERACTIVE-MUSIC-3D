# CI Optimization Summary

## Performance Improvements Made

The CI workflow has been optimized from ~50 minutes to an estimated **10-15 minutes** through the following changes:

### 1. Job Parallelization

- **Before**: All steps ran sequentially (lint → typecheck → build → test)
- **After**: Split into parallel jobs:
  - `quality-checks`: Lint and TypeScript checking run in parallel
  - `build`: Production build with caching
  - `visual-regression`: Tests run in parallel across browser matrix

### 2. Enhanced Caching Strategy

- **Node.js dependencies**: Cache `node_modules` and `~/.npm` to avoid 1.1GB re-download
- **Next.js build cache**: Cache `.next/cache` and build artifacts
- **Playwright browsers**: Improved browser-specific caching
- **TypeScript cache**: Implicit caching through Node.js cache

### 3. Optimized Browser Matrix

- **PR builds**: Run only Chromium + Mobile Safari (most important browsers)
- **Main branch**: Run full matrix (5 browsers) for comprehensive coverage
- **Browser-specific installation**: Only install browsers needed for each matrix job

### 4. Build Artifact Sharing

- Build once, test multiple times using uploaded artifacts
- Eliminates duplicate builds across browser matrix jobs

### 5. Better Process Management

- Use `start-server-and-test` for reliable server startup/shutdown
- Improved cleanup and error handling
- Increased workers from 1 to 2 for better parallelization

### 6. Reduced Retries

- Decreased from 2 to 1 retry for faster feedback
- Better error reporting with GitHub Actions reporter

## Expected Time Savings

| Step | Before | After | Savings |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| Dependencies | ~5 min | ~30 sec | 4.5 min |
| Lint + TypeCheck | ~4 min | ~2 min | 2 min (parallel) |
| Build | ~3 min | ~3 min | 0 (cached for reuse) |
| Browser Install | ~10 min | ~2 min | 8 min (per browser) |
| Test Execution | ~30 min | ~8 min | 22 min (parallel + reduced matrix) |

**Total estimated time**: 10-15 minutes (down from 50+ minutes)

## Browser Testing Strategy

### Pull Request (Fast Feedback)

- Chromium (most common desktop browser)
- Mobile Safari (iOS coverage)

### Main Branch (Full Coverage)

- Chromium
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)
- Mobile Chrome
- Mobile Safari

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Cache hit rates**: Monitor artifact cache effectiveness
2. **Job timing**: Track individual job durations
3. **Flaky tests**: Reduced retries will expose flaky tests faster
4. **Browser matrix**: Adjust based on usage analytics

## Future Optimizations

1. **Conditional execution**: Skip tests for documentation-only changes
2. **Incremental testing**: Only test affected components
3. **Parallel test sharding**: Split large test suites across multiple runners
4. **Pre-built Docker images**: Cache entire environment setup

## Usage

The optimized workflow will run automatically on:

- Push to `main` branch (full browser matrix)
- Pull requests (reduced browser matrix)

To run specific browsers locally:

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Safari"
```

To update dependencies and refresh caches:

```bash
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
```
